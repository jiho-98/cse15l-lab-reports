This is how I modify the StringServer in the VScode
* The function called "HandleRequest" is used for the part 1.
*handleRequest(URI url) method: this method is called by the server to handle incoming HTTP requests. The URI argument represents the request URL. 
* `messageBuilder`: a StringBuilder object used to append and store messages passed in through the /add-message path.
* `url.getQuery()` method: returns the query component of the URL as a string.
* `url.getPath()` method: returns the path component of the URL as a string.
